# Face-Recognition-and-Chatbot-combined

This module just combines the Face Recogniton using Haar Cascades code and the chatbot using Neural Networks code to make a bigger system of recognizing a face given as an input to the Face Recognition system. If not identified, then the chatbot asks for the details of the person which would be saved in a file against the person's facial features. 
You have implement the codes I have given for Face Recognition as well as the Chatbot using Neural Networks to run this code.
